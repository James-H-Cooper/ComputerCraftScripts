# A set of scripts for ComputerCraft (specifically CC:Tweaked) for my personal use.
The scripts are not particularly polished and probably contain bugs. 
---------------
To download the entire repro to a turtle, run the following:

* pastebin get wPtGKMam github
* github James-H-Cooper ComputerCraftScripts ./

--------------
Note that if the turtle leaves a loaded chunk or the server closes, it will cease operation <br>
It may be advisable to name the script you wish to use as 'startup' so that it runs whenever the turtle is reloaded
